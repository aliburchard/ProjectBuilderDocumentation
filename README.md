# ProjectBuilderDocumentation
Documenting the data pipeline and project building process on Zooniverse

We currently have various documentation for project builders here:
* zooniverse.org/lab-how-to
* https://www.zooniverse.org/lab-policies
* https://www.zooniverse.org/lab-best-practices/introduction

...but most folks find the current "how-to" tutorial a bit long. And there's a LOT that needs documenting in other ways. So my goal is to

1. document what still needs documenting (help much appreciated!)
2. figure out how to more effectively parse/organize the existing tutorial
