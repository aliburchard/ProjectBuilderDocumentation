## About

Contains pages for Research, Team, FAQ, Results, and Education: These pages are where you really get to share all the cool things about your project. All of these pages use Markdown (see link above) to format text and display images.

Research: Explain your research to your audience here in as much detail as you'd like. This page displays no matter what, since explaining your motivation to volunteers is critical for the success of your project!

Results: Once your project has hit its stride, share the results of your project with your volunteers here. This page will only display if you add content to it.

FAQ: Add details here about your research, how to classify, and what you plan to do with the classifications. This page can evolve as your project does so that your active community members have a resource to point new users to. This page will only display if you add content to it.

Education: If you are a researcher open to collaborating with educators you can state that here, include educational content, and describe how you'd like to help educators use your project. Also, if your project is primarily for educational purposes you can describe that here. This page will only display if you add content to it.
