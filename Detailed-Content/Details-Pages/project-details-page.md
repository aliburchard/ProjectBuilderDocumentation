## Project Details

Name: The project name is the first thing people will see and it will show up in the project URL. Try to keep it short and sweet.

Avatar: Pick an avatar image for your project. This will represent your project on the Zooniverse home page. It can also be used as your project's brand. It's best if it's recognizable even as a small icon. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use a square image of not more than 50KB, but at minimum 100x100 pixels.

Background: This image will be the background for all of your project pages, including your project's front page, which newcomers will see first. It should be relatively high resolution and you should be able to read text written across it. To add an image, either drag and drop or click to open your file viewer. For best results, use images of at least 1 megapixel, no larger than 256 KB. Most people's screens are not much bigger than 1300 pixels across and 750 pixels high, so if your image is a lot bigger than this you may find it doesn't look the way you expect. Feel free to experiment with different sizes on a "typical" desktop, laptop or mobile screen.

Description: This should be a one-line call to action for your project. This will display on your landing page and, if approved, on the Zooniverse home page. Some volunteers will decide whether to try your project based on reading this, so try to write short text that will make people actively want to join your project.

Introduction: Add a brief introduction to get people interested in your project. This will display on your project's front page. Note this field (renders markdown)[http://markdownlivepreview.com/], so you can format the text. You can make this longer than the Description, but it's still probably best to save much longer text for areas like the Research Case or FAQ tabs.

Checkbox: Volunteers choose workflow: A workflow is a set of tasks a volunteer completes to create a classification. Your project might have multiple workflows (if you want to set different tasks for different image sets). Check this to let volunteers select which workflow they want to work on; otherwise, they'll be served workflow-subject pairs randomly.

Checkbox: Private project:
On "private" projects, only users with specified project roles can see or classify on the project. We strongly recommend you keep your project private while you're still working out its details. Share it with your team to get feedback by adding them in the Collaborators area (linked at the left). Team members you add can see your project even if it's private. Once your project is public, anyone with the link can view and classify on it.
