## Collaborators
Add people to your team and specify what their roles are so that they have the right access to the tools they need (including access to the project before it's public).

Owner: The owner is the original project creator. There can be only one.

Collaborator: Collaborators have full access to edit workflows and project content, including deleting some or all of the project.

Expert: Experts can enter “gold mode” to make authoritative gold standard classifications that will be used to validate data quality.

Researcher: Members of the research team will be marked as researchers on “Talk"

Moderator: Moderators have extra privileges in the community discussion area to moderate discussions. They will also be marked as moderators on “Talk".

Tester: Testers can view and classify on your project to give feedback while it’s still private. They cannot access the project builder.

Translator: Translators will have access to the project builder as well as the translation site, so they can translate all of your project text into a different language.
