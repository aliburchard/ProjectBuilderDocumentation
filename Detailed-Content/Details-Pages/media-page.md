## Media
You can upload your own media to your project (such as example images for your help pages) so you can link to it without an external host. To start uploading, drop an image into the box (or click it to bring up your file browser and select a file).

Once the image has uploaded, it will appear above the "Add an image" box. You can then copy the markdown text beneath the image into your project, or add another image.
