# The slightly-more-detailed-version of the quick-start guide for project building.



**Create Tasks**
Create tasks with the "Add New Task" Button. Delete tasks with the little "Delete this task" button on the bottom right hand side. *Note: When you create a new workflow, a question task is automatically created. You'll need to delete it if you don't want to ask your volunteers questions.

** Wiring tasks together **
After you've created all your tasks, you need to wire them together. Set your first task using the "First Task" dropdown menu below the "Add Task" button. Then for each task, you have to specify *what comes next*. In question tasks, you can specify different "Next Tasks" for different answers (provided users can only select one answer)
Subject retirement: Decide how many people you want to see each photo. You'll use the beta test to refine this number. We suggest starting out kinda high, like 10-20.
Multi-Image options: If you have more than one subject in your subject set (like on www.snapshotserengeti.org), decide how users will see them.

## Task Details
Tasks can be Questions or Markings. Both types have "Main Text" boxes where you can ask your questions or tell users what to draw, as well as provide additional support for answering the question in the "Help Text" box.

### Questions:
Choices: This section contains all your answers. The key features of this section are:
  - Required: if you select this, the user will HAVE to answer the question before moving on.
  - Multiple: if you select this, the user can select more than one answer -- use this for "select all that apply" type questions.
  - Next Task: The “Next task” selection (which appears below the text box for each answer) describes what task you want the volunteer to perform next after they give a particular answer. You can choose from among the tasks you’ve already defined. If you want to link a task to another you haven’t built yet, you can come back and do it later (don’t forget to save your changes).

### Marking:
Choices: This section contains all the different things people can mark. We call each separate option a "Tool" and you can specify a label, colour, and tool type for each option. Check out the Aggregation docs to understand how multiple volunteer answers are turned into final shapes for your data analysis!

Tool types are:
- *point:* X marks the spot.
- *line:* a straight line at any angle.
- *polygon:* an arbitrary shape made of point-to-point lines.
- *rectangle:* a box of any size and length-width ratio; this tool *cannot* be rotated.
- *circle:* a point and a radius.
- *ellipse:* an oval of any size and axis ratio; this tool *can* be rotated.
