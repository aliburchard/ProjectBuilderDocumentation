Great job! You've built a project and now have real data to explore!

**There are four types of project data outputs**
1. Subjects
2. Classifications
3. Workflow content
4. Workflow data

**And two types of talk data outputs**
1. Talk comments

Note that the project data outputs are technically csv files, but typically include JSON formatted fields inside the csv. Fields returned as JSON are indicated here with {json} after the field name and embedded in {}. Fields returned as arrays indicated by [array] after the field name and embedded in [].
